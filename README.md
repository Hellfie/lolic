LoL icon changer

Almost entirely ripped off lcu-driver example code, only their exmaple, for some reason, were choosing icon on random

To work requires lcu-driver and python installed in your system: https://github.com/sousa-andre/lcu-driver

To use launch league client, then launch the iconchangerINPUT.py and enter the icon id. 29 will try to set blank icon and 65 is Katarina chibi thing



Solid list of icon id's can be found here: https://lolmath.net/articles/summoner-icons/
