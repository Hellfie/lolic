LoL icon changer
Almost entirely ripped off lcu-driver example code, only their exmaple, for some reason, were choosing icon on random
To work requires lcu-driver and python installed in your system: https://github.com/sousa-andre/lcu-driver
To use launch league client, then launch the iconchangerINPUT.py and enter the icon id. 29 will try to set blank icon and 65 is Katarina chibi thing

Solid list of icon id's can be found here: https://lolmath.net/articles/summoner-icons/
